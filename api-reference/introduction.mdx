## Welcome

Mailist API allows you to integrate email marketing capabilities into your applications. You can manage subscribers, campaigns, templates, and track email performance programmatically.

## Base URL

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can generate API keys from your Mailist dashboard under Settings > API Keys.

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses include a `data` object, while errors include an `error` object with details.
